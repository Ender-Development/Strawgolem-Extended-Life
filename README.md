# Straw Golem

This mod adds a spawnable straw golem. It's a very weak golem and flees whenever hostile mobs come nearby, but it can harvest full grown crops (however it can't pick up drop).

Since the original repo is unfortunately currently no longer maintained, we have decided to re-release the mod with the blacklist fix of Gaphodil.
